### üî∑ Introduction

This repository hosts the official whitepaper for the KRYONIS sovereign validation architecture in response to the Mastercard‚ÄìChainlink protocol convergence (announced June 24, 2025). It presents a complete framework for integrating **Presence Alignment Score (PAS/PoC)**-based biometric coherence into traditional financial systems without compromising decentralization, privacy, or epistemic integrity.

### üß† Key Components

- **Protocol Bridge Layer:**  
  Featuring DCE (Decentralized Coherence Engine), OAG (Oracle Aggregation Gateway), and LIM (Legacy Interface Module)

- **Biometric Oracle Integration:**  
  Adapts Chainlink-type oracles to verify non-financial biometric coherence (PAS/PoC) through secure cryptographic commitments

- **Tokenomic Framework:**  
  Dual-token model: a CBDC-compatible stable transaction layer + a sovereign resonance-based token for governance and rewards

- **Meta-Economic Identity Protocol:**  
  Real-time coherence as a gating parameter for capital access, governance, and resource distribution across CBDC and DeFi layers

### üåê About KRYONIS

KRYONIS is a post-fiat civilizational protocol that redefines economic participation through **biometric resonance** rather than price, credit, or speculative value. This document lays the groundwork for its secure interoperability with legacy systems while preserving **sovereign coherence filters**.
